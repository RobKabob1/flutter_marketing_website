# Video Game Marketing Website

Website for a fake game showcasing Flutter's ability to make a marketing web page.

The live site is located [here](https://deeps-website.web.app/).

### Advantages
- Highly capable in creating excellent, quality websites
- Responsive based on screen size

### Disadvantages
- Flutter does not have the ability to heavily customize SEO capability.

#### Evalution
All things considered, I would opt to use a marketing-based CMS for a web landing page. If the goal is to build a web application, Flutter is more than capable and should be used. However, work with a javascript-based web tool for creating a marketing site.

In Flutter's own words [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/faq)

```
In general, Flutter is geared towards dynamic application experiences. Flutter's web support
is no exception. Flutter web prioritizes performance, fidelity, and consistency. This means
application output does not align with what search engines need to properly index. For web
content that is static or document-like, we recommend using HTML—just like we do on
flutter.dev, dart.dev, and pub.dev. You should also consider separating your primary
application experience—created in Flutter—from your landing page, marketing content, and help
content—created using search-engine optimized HTML.
